Program Name: Deck-of-Cards

Description: This Java program simulates a deck of playing cards and demonstrates the use of a stack data structure. It populates a full standard deck, randomly selects five cards, and pushes them onto a stack. The cards are then popped from the stack and revealed one by one, illustrating the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) behavior of stacks.

Key Concepts and Tools Used

 Stack Data Structure (LIFO principle)

 Object-Oriented Programming (Card and DeckOfCards classes)

 Random Selection of Cards

 Java Collections Framework

 Basic I/O and Console Output

How It Works
A full deck of cards is created and stored in a collection.
Five cards are randomly selected from the deck.
Each selected card is pushed onto a stack.
The program then pops and displays each card from the stack.

Inputs and Outputs
Inputs: No user input is required. The selection of cards is handled internally through randomization.

Outputs: Printed messages indicating that five cards have been selected.
Each card is displayed as it is popped from the stack (in reverse order of insertion).
